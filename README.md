# MyReads Project

MyReads is an application built as the first assignment for the Udacity React nanodegree. The application provides functionality to move books between three states: Currently Reading, Read, and Want to Read. In addition to assigning these states, the application also provides functionality to search for books using a Udacity provided API. This API has limited functionality as far as search capabilities is concerned. Further documentation is available in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).
